This is a tiny script that displays the "Algebraic identities" with a simple visual representation.
It uses 2 sliders to control the values of the 2 variables and dynamically displays and updates them on screen, as well as the geometric "proof".
Made while learning **JavaScript** and **p5.js**.
___
The important files are:
+ **index.html**: Main html file containing all the elements: buttons, p5 canvas, description. etc
+ **sketch-a+b2.js**: JavaScript sketch called in the .html file, contains the code, functions and variables.
+ **lang.js**: Second JavaScript sketch called in the index. Contains the translations and language changing functions.(NOT READY YET)
+ **libraries folder**: Contains the p5.js libraries, also called in the HTML file, necessary to run all of the p5 functions inside the code. To update them and use newer functions, just download the newest version from [the p5.js website](https://p5js.org/download/).
+ **imgs folder**: Contains the images used in the project.(EMPTY)
